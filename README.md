# DND 5e Program


### Video Demo:
TBD


#### Description
There are a lot of Dungeons & Dragons programs out there but a lot of them work on outdated knowledge as well as being full of ads or require a monthly subscription. So I made my own.

The program features customizable dice rolls with unique character sheets. Users may save or load their own files.

Each character sheet has the character's name, their pronouns, and stats. Dice roll modifiers are automatically applied on each roll.

One can also create a campaign sheet detailing everything the party has encountered so far.

The program abides by the [Wizards of the Coast's Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy).

#### Misc
The project is free and open source. The .gitignore solely features required tokens. If you wish to build this project on your own, make a small file with the tokens you need.
